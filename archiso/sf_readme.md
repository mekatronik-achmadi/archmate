# Arch-Linux Custom ISO

This is just example of custom Arch-Linux ISOs using Archiso dan Pacstrap tools.

**NOTE:** This works done by myself just as a hobby and I had no any relation to amazing people in Arch-Linux Dev Team.

## ISO Variants

### Mate Desktop

The **archlinux-mate_012024-x86_64.iso** contain Mate Desktop and Openbox WM with LightDM as Login Manager.

### Command Line Interface

The **archlinux-cli_012024-x86_64.iso** contain Bash interface as default with additional Openbox WM.

The Openbox WM can be started using command:

```sh
startx /usr/bin/openbox-session
```
